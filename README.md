## 100. Restaurant App - Stg 3 Offline Reviews
### Day 100: October 2, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Offline Alert](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-14-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-14.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

I finished another round of 100DaysOfCode! Yay! I was hoping to be done with this project by now but it looks like it'll take me into Round 4.

This latest set of code changes represented significant updates to my Restaurant Review app. This included

- Created `offline` IDB object store for saving unhandled http requests
- Implemented graceful offline handling of review data
- Created ability to add and capture new data regardless of connectivity 

See the code notes here: [Restaurant Review App - Stage 3: Section 9 Offline Reviews](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/stage3.html#9-offline-reviews).

## 99. Restaurant App - Stage 3 IDB Store & Index
### Day 99: September 30, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![IDB Index](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-13-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-13.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

Next I needed to create an object store to hold data so users can have an uninterrupted offline experience.

I this case I added the `reviews` object store as well as an index (foreign key) that relates the review back to the restaurant.

See the code notes here: [Restaurant Review App - Stage 3: Section 8 Review Store](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/stage3.html#8-reviews-store).

## 98. Restaurant App - Stage 3 New Gulp Build
### Day 98: September 29, 2018 - Saturday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

<!-- [![Old IDB Schema](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/2-13-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/2-13.jpg) -->

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

I created a new set of Gulp build tasks to successfully transform & bundle my IDB code.

#### gulpfile.js

```js
// DBHelper
gulp.task('dbhelper', function () {
  var bundler = browserify([                   // ['1.js', '2.js']
    './app/js/idbhelper.js',                   // include these files
    './app/js/dbhelper.js'
  ], { debug: false });                        // no sourcemaps

  return bundler
    .transform(babelify, {sourceMaps: false})  // required for 'import'
    .bundle()                                  // concat
    .pipe(source('dbhelper.min.js'))           // get text stream w/ dest filename
    .pipe(buffer())                            // use stream w/ other plugins
    .pipe(gulp.dest('.tmp/js/'));              // outout here...
});
```

This combines multiple script files and automatically imports dependencies like the one shown below...

#### idbhelper.js

```js
import idb from 'idb';

const dbPromise = idb.open('udacity-restaurant-db', 1, upgradeDB => {
  switch (upgradeDB.oldVersion) {
    case 0:
      upgradeDB.createObjectStore('restaurants', 
        { keyPath: 'id', unique: true });
  }
});

self.idbKeyVal = idbKeyVal;   // <- This line exposes the object literal.
```

There are now easier ways to do this with tools like [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) and [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/) but Grunt & Gulp are what the lessons taught so I stuck with those.

## 97. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Update IDB Schema
### Day 97: September 28, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Old IDB Schema](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/2-13-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/2-13.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

Stage 3 required me to update the object store schema for `restaurants`.

As you can see above, I had previously just saved the entire json list of restaurants as one IDB store record.

This no longer works since I now need to update data on an individual restaurant basis. Here's what the updated schema looks like now.

[![Updated IDB Schema](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-11-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-11.jpg)

You can read more about the code changes in my code notes.

## 96. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Save Review
### Day 96: September 24, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

Added code to save a review from the Add Review modal pop-up to the database.  This consisted of adding two pieces of code.

#### restaurant_info.js

```js
const saveAddReview = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  const name = document.querySelector('#reviewName').value;
  const rating = document.querySelector('input[name=rate]:checked').value;
  const comments = document.querySelector('#reviewComments').value;

  DBHelper.createRestaurantReview(self.restaurant.id, name, rating, comments,
    (error, review) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log('Error saving review');
    } else {
      console.log(review);
      window.location.href = `/restaurant.html?id=${self.restaurant.id}`;
    }
  });
};
```

#### dbhelper.js

```js
// http://localhost:1337/reviews/
static createRestaurantReview(id, name, rating, comments, callback) {
  const data = {
    'restaurant_id': id,
    'name': name,
    'rating': rating,
    'comments': comments
  };
  fetch(DBHelper.DATABASE_URL + '/reviews/', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => callback(null, data))
    .catch(err => callback(err, null));
}
```

## 95. Restaurant App - Stage 3 CodePen Review Form
### Day 95: September 16, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![CodePen Review Form](assets/images/code-log-95-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-95.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

I copied the relevant modal popup code to a CodePen ([Modal popup with star rating](https://codepen.io/james-priest/pen/NLLEzr)) in case anyone wants to see how this thing is constructed.

The star rating was the most complex part of the form since it required me to manually specify proper ARIA, accessibility, and roles within the control.

This CodePen proof of concept contains:
- Basic form validation
- Keyboard navigation with proper modal trap so that focus stays within modal group on TAB
- ARIA and accessibility labels and roles
- Proper Arrow Key navigation within Radio Group (Star rating control)

## 94. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Add Review Form
### Day 94: September 14, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Add Review Form](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-8-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-8.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

This consisted of implementing an "Add Review" form with a hidden radio group modified to mimic a favorite star rating control.

This was the most complex part of form since it required proper ARIA, accessibility, and role specification.

I also added the following:
- Form validation
- Keyboard navigation with proper modal trap
- ARIA and accessibility labels and roles

See the code notes here: [Restaurant Review App - Stage 3: Section 5. Add Review Form](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/stage3.html#5-add-review-form).

## 93. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Create Modal Popup
### Day 93: September 12, 2018 - Wednesday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Modal Display](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-6-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-6.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

In order to get the modal popup to happen I had to:

- Create a button to trigger the modal display
    [![Modal button](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-5-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-5.jpg)
- Create a "Close" button on the modal popup
- Wire-up the buttons with the appropriate js code to show or hide the modal when clicked
- Add a transition so the modal fades in and out smoothly

See the code notes here: [Restaurant Review App - Stage 3: Section 4.2 Create a Modal Popup](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/stage3.html#42-create-a-modal-popup).

## 92. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Display Reviews
### Day 92: September 10, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Display Reviews](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-4-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/3-4.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

In order to get the reviews to display properly I had to do the following:

- Create a `fetchRestaurantReviewById` method
- Modify `createReviewHTML` & `fillReviewsHTML` methods
- Update CSS for Review display styles

See the code notes here: [Restaurant Review App - Stage 3: Section 4.1 Display Reviews](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/stage3.html#41-display-reviews).

**Progress:** Continued the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

This last few days consisted of:
- Creating a Favorite Toggle Control (Rollover Image)
- Making sure it was ARIA compliant & Accessible
- Writing the database code to update the db
- Applying the code to index & detail pages
- Testing to make everything works end to end

## 90. Restaurant App - Stage 3 Reqs & API Endpoints
### Day 90: September 7, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Endpoints](assets/images/code-log-90-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-90.jpg)

**Progress:** Began the *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 3* project.

#### Requirements
The first step of this project involved understanding the new requirements. These come down to the following:

- Setup the REST server / review new end points
- Create Favorite toggle control
- Create Review form
- Bind new data to controls
- Cache new data to IDB
- Save review data when offline / Post when back online 
- Ensure Lighthouse performance benchmarks meet the following:
  - **Progressive Web App** - 90 or better
  - **Performance** - 90 or better
  - **Accessibility** - 90 or better

#### Web API Endpoints
Next I documented in my Code Notes each of the new API Endpoints.

I used an app called PostMan to test each of these CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations which fall into the following categories.

- **GET** - Methods to read from the database
- **POST** - Methods to create new database records
- **PUT** - Methods to update existing database records
- **DELETE** - Methods to delete database records

## 84. Restaurant App - Stage 2 Progressive Web App
### Day 84: August 25, 2018 - Saturday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![PWA Generator](assets/images/code-log-84-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-84.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Today I needed to improve my Lighthouse PWA score in order to satisfy the Stage 2 Project requirements. They were in the low 70s and needed to be brought up above 90.

The Lighthouse stats page gave a checklist of items to fix.

[![PWA Generator](assets/images/code-log-84a-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-84a.jpg)

Once I fixed as many of these as I could the score came up tremendously.

I used the Firebase's Web App Manifest Generator ([https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/](https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/))

Here's my new score!

[![PWA Generator](assets/images/code-log-84b-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-84b.jpg)

## 83. Restaurant App - Stage 2 Offline with IDB
### Day 83: August 24, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![IDB data](assets/images/code-log-83-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-83.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Finished integrating IndexedDB into the Service Worker for graceful offline performance!

Now the data is showing up and available for offline use. This means that if internet is lost the app can still show data and provide a seamless offline browsing experience.

[![App offline](assets/images/code-log-83a-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-83a.jpg)

In fact, if the restaurant page had previously been visited it will seemlessly bring in the map and any associated images as well as the data.

Otherwise it will show placeholders for images that have not been cached but the information will still display.

[![App offline 2](assets/images/code-log-83b-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-83b.jpg)

Now when I run a performance test is scores in the mid to high 70's and works for offline browsing as well.

## 82. Nested Promise Blues
### Day 82: August 23, 2018 - Thursday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Nested Promises](assets/images/code-log-82a-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-82a.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

At some point these nested calls get pretty crazy. The code fails mercilessly if you miss a comma, a bracket, a parenthesis, etc.

That's manageable to find with syntax highlighting in your editor, but when you need to insert a nested `then()` with conditional statements, it gets tough to keep it straight.

Case in point. The code below took hours over days to get all pieces in the right place.

```js
function idbResponse(request) {
  return caches.open(staticCacheName).then(function (cache) {
    return cache.match(request).then(function (response) {
      return (
        response || fetch(request).then(function (networkResponse) {
          cache.add(request, networkResponse.clone());
          return networkResponse;
        })
      );
    });
  }).catch(error => {
    if (request.url.includes('.jpg')) {
      return caches.match('/img/fixed/offline_img1.png');
    }
    return new Response(error, {
      status: 404,
      statusText: 'Not connected to the internet'
    });
  });
}
```

I'm sure it looks clean and straightforward to read the logic now but now

I guess it'll get faster with practice.

## 81. Restaurant App - Stage 2 Build & Serve
### Day 81: August 17, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Gulp serve](assets/images/code-log-81-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-81.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Finished fine-tuning the Gulp scripts for development & distribution builds.

This final part of the build system involved serving the pages and providing live reload on code changes. This was done with a plugin called `browsersync`.

I did this by creating three main tasks.
- `gulp serve` - creates a development server with live reload
- `gulp serve:dist` - optimizes code and create a preview for a production build
- `gulp` - builds a production ready site without spinning up a server

The build system will efficiently lint, bundle, transpile, concatenate, minify, autoprefix, & optimize my code on every save.

Now that this is automated, I can spend more time focusing on the code!

## 79. Restaurant App - Stage 2 Responsive Images
### Day 79: August 15, 2018 - Wednesday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Responsive Images](assets/images/code-log-79-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-79.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Today I implemented responsive image optimization code in the build system to produce four copies of each image at a different resolution.

This will allow the site to responsively serve whichever size image is most appropriate for the requesting device.

The code is pretty straight forward and much more concise in Gulp than the same configuration in Grunt.

```js
// Build responsive images
var gulp = require('gulp');
var $ = require('gulp-load-plugins')();

gulp.task('images', ['fixed-images'], function () {
  return gulp.src('app/img/*.jpg')
    .pipe($.responsive({
      '*.jpg': [
        { width: 300, rename: { suffix: '-300' }, },
        { width: 400, rename: { suffix: '-400' }, },
        { width: 600, rename: { suffix: '-600_2x' }, },
        { width: 800, rename: { suffix: '-800_2x' }, }
      ]
    }, {
      quality: 40,
      progressive: true,
      withMetadata: false,
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('.tmp/img'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/img'));
});
```

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Added Section *4. Fix Grunt Tasks* to my Code Notes.

This details the changes I made to my existing Grunt config file in order to make it work with the new directory structure.

It also details hiding my Google Maps API key so that it doesn't get posted on GitHub.

Grunt now does the following tasks.

- `clean` - cleans the dist/ folder
- `copy` - copies all source code folders & files that don’t need pre-processing to dist/
- `string-replace` - copies the Google Maps API key to the HTML files
- `responsive_images` - creates each image at various pixel densities to adjust for various device pixel ratios and viewport sizes

## 76. Terminal Makeover
### Day 76: August 7, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** Update Windows 10 Terminal with tabs, split screens, & themes

[![Split Terminal with Tabs](assets/images/code-log-76b-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-76b.jpg)

**Progress:** This was a three day project due to much reading and research.

Here were my terminal minimum requirements:
- Must have tabs
- Must be able to do split-screen
- Must be customizable with plug-ins & themes
- Must work properly on Windows 10 WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

This lead me to some great articles on how to do this. The first one I read was [How to Use ‘Tmux Terminal’ to Access Multiple Terminals Inside a Single Console](https://www.tecmint.com/tmux-to-access-multiple-linux-terminals-inside-a-single-console/).

This introduced tmux (Terminal Multiplexer), which allows you to access multiple terminals inside a single terminal. This is a Linux tool though and I wasn't sure whether Windows 10 WSL could support it. Here's what I found.

- MS Developer Blog - [Tmux support arrives for Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2016/06/08/tmux-support-arrives-for-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/)
- MS Developer Blog - [Tmux improvements - Background Task Support in WSL](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/tag/tmux/)

I then read the following three Win 10 specific walk-through's
- [How to split the terminal into multiple screens in Windows 10](https://veerasundar.com/blog/2018/03/how-to-split-the-terminal-into-multiple-views-in-windows-10/)
    This helped me install tmux & zsh which gave me split screens and themes but not tabs.
- [Configuring a pretty and usable terminal emulator for WSL](https://blog.ropnop.com/configuring-a-pretty-and-usable-terminal-emulator-for-wsl/)
    This was a great breakdown of the various Win 10 Terminal replacement apps out there. Many of which support tabs but each with their own limitations.
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux w/ zsh, tmux & Docker](https://blog.questionable.services/article/windows-subsystem-linux-zsh-tmux-docker/)
    This solution integrates all of the previous tools but relies on Hyper as a terminal replacement which the previous article wasn't to keen on. Good for reference though.

What I finally ended up doing was installing a Windows Tab solution called [Groupy](https://www.stardock.com/products/groupy/) which allows you to organize multiple applications into grouped tabs. Very simple drag and drop functionality.

[![Code Notes](assets/images/code-log-75a-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-75a.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

The last three days was spent creating a code log for Stage 2 of my Restaurant App project.

[![Code Notes](assets/images/code-log-75-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-75.jpg)

So far I have the following sections.

1. Project Prep - Fork & Clone dev server; install dependencies;
2. Update Ajax to use Fetch API
3. Update folder structure to accommodate a build process

These notes will detail the steps I take to satisfy my project requirements. I'll also include screenshots and code samples where necessary.

## 74. Restaurant App - Stage 2 Transpile & Bundle
### Day 74: August 1, 2018 - Wednesday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Performance Benchmarks](assets/images/code-log-74-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-74.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Today was spent figuring out how to Transpile & Bundle dependency scripts into a single JavaScript file.

This means I was able to use Babel to target the latest two versions of each major browser to ensure the JavaScript would run properly.

I also added the following

- Basic BrowserSync for live reloading
- Linting
- Bundling
- Transpiling
- Minification

This increased my benchmark scores for Performance & Progressive Web App.

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Code Editor](assets/images/code-log-73-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-73.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Today I started down the rabbit hole that is Gulpfile.js. Gulp uses a code-based build process as opposed to Grunt's config based approach.

So far I have the following tasks working.

- `clean` - cleans the `dist/` & `tmp/` directories
- `html` - copies html & injects Google Maps API key
- `css` - copies css
- `js` - copies js

What I need to get working in each of these tasks.

- `html` - processes html (remove comments, remove whitespace, etc. )
- `css` - processes css (autoprefixer, sass)
- `js` - processes js (bundle, browserify, transpile)
- `watch` - dev server with live reload when source changes

Will continue tomorrow.

## 72. Restaurant App - Stage 2 Fix Grunt Tasks
### Day 72: July 30, 2018 - Monday

[![Code Editor](assets/images/code-log-72-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-72.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Today was about getting my existing Grunt tasks to work with my new (proper) build process folder structure. Added the following tasks.

- `clean` - cleans the `dist/` folder
- `copy` - copies all source code folders & files that don't need pre-processing to `dist/`
- `string-replace` - copies the Google Maps API key to the HTML files
- `responsive_images` - creates each image at various pixel densities to adjust for various device pixel ratios and viewport sizes

I created a separate Google Maps API key file that does not get copied GitHub. I placed the file name in `.gitignore` and added a Grunt task to copy the key to the HTML files when the project is built.

Now when I push my project to GitHub my API key will not get published.

## 71. Restaurant App - Stage 2 New App Structure
### Day 71: July 29, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Code Editor](assets/images/code-log-71-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-71.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Today I updated the structure of the client app by placing all source code files in an `app/` folder and then updating the gruntfile to output to a `dist/` folder.

This will provide a clean segmentation between our working source and the final compressed and optimized site.

Next steps are to migrate from Grunt to Gulp which will allow for better code based configuration and the create an additional set of build tasks to do the following:

- Handle the new directory structure
- Provide better linting & error trapping
- Allow

## 70. Restaurant App - Stage 2 Gulp Prep
### Day 70: July 28, 2018 - Saturday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Spend the day looking into the best way to put together a Gulp Build Environment & Workflow.

This consisted of:

- Investigating various pre-built solutions
  - Yeoman's [generator-gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp)
  - Google's [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/starter-kit/)
- Looked into rolling my own
- Researched various individual Gulp plugins
  - gulp-responsive-images
  - browserify
  - gulp-bro
  - browser-sync
  - gulp-sass
  - gulp-autoprefix
  - gulp-babel
  - gulp-uglify
  - gulp-useref
  - gulp-htmlmin
  - and many more...

Decided to roll my own in order to get granular control over the build process.

The next step is to copy all source files into an `app/` directory and then have everything output to a  `dest/` folder.

## 69. Restaurant App - Stage 2 Fetch API
### Day 69: July 27, 2018 - Friday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Today was about replacing the old XHR code with Fetch API and Promise based error handling.

**Old XHR code**

```js
let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', DBHelper.DATABASE_URL);
xhr.onload = () => {
  if (xhr.status === 200) { // Got a success response from server!
    const json = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
    const restaurants = json.restaurants;
    callback(null, restaurants);
  } else { // Oops!. Got an error from server.
    const error = (`Request failed. Returned status of ${xhr.status}`);
    callback(error, null);
  }
};
xhr.send();
```

**New fetch code**

```js
fetch(DBHelper.DATABASE_URL)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(restaurants => callback(null, restaurants))
  .catch(err => callback(err, null));
```

Additional changes included updates to the supporting DBHelper routines for proper responsive image handling.

## 68. Restaurant App - Stage 2 Requirements
### Day 68: July 26, 2018 - Thursday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Fetch](assets/images/code-log-68-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-68.jpg)

**Progress:** Started *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 2* project.

Today I began work on stage 2 of my Restaurant App project. This requires that we do the following:

- Pull the data through Ajax (Fetch) from a live data source (node server)
- Cache the data using IndexedDB
- Create a build system using Grunt, Gulp, Yeoman, or Webpack
- Ensure it passes Lighthouse performance benchmarks

Once these requirements are met I can submitted everything for review. Successful submission of stages 1, 2, and 3 are required to complete the nanodegree program.

## 67. jQuery Scroller
### Day 67: July 25, 2018 - Wednesday

**Project:** Code Log Improvements

[![CodePen Scroll](assets/images/code-log-67-small.jpg)](assets/images/code-log-67.jpg)

**Progress:** This was slow going and required a lot of back and forth testing.

The scroll code requires each section to be wrapped so that height can be calculated in order to properly set the `active` class. Unfortunately, the code sets and removes the class dozens of times for each scroll event. This needs to be fixed.

It also dynamically adds and removes the `active` class on each nav item between the one you are on and the destination menu item so that each menu item in between also highlights during smooth scroll.  This is fine for small nav menus but gets clunky with large menus.

In the end I wasn't able to use it for this log but I'll try some other options as time permits.

## 54. Promise Error Handling
### Day 54: July 4, 2018 - Wednesday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Promises Course Map](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/prom2-8-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/prom2-8.jpg)

**Progress:** Started *Lesson 2: Chaining Promises* from
- Udacity course: [JavaScript Promises](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-promises--ud898) by Google.

These lessons covered
- Promise's reject rules
- `.catch` vs `reject` function
  - `.catch(function(error) { })`
  - `get('example.json').then(undefined, rejectFunc)`
  - `.catch` is preferred cause it's easier to read and write
- differences between `.catch` and `reject` function
- CAN'T call both `resolve` & `reject` functions
  - Only one or the other gets called
  - ```js
    get('example.json').then(resolveFunc, rejectFunc)
    ```
- CAN call both `.then` and `.catch` blocks
  - `.then` can execute and have an error which triggers `.catch` to execute
  - ```js
    get('example.json')
    .then(resolveFunc)
    .catch(rejectFunc);
    ```

Here's a short code example with thening and multiple `.catch` blocks.

```js
getJSON('../data/earth-like-results.json')
  .then(function (response) {
    addSearchHeader(response.query);
    console.log(response);
    return getJSON(response.results[0]);  // return result for chaining
  }).catch(function () {                  // catch err in search request
    throw Error('Search Request Error');
  }).then(function (planetData) {         // receive result in planetData
    createPlanetThumb(planetData);
    console.log(planetData);
  }).catch(function (error) {             // catch any other error
    addSearchHeader('unknown');
    console.log(error);
  });
```

## 52. Promise Chaining
### Day 52: July 2, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Promises Course Map](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/prom1-33-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/prom1-33.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Lesson 1: Creating Promises* from
- Udacity course: [JavaScript Promises](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-promises--ud898) by Google.

```js
function ready() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    function checkState() {
      if(document.readyState !== 'loading') {
        resolve();
      }
    }
    document.addEventListener('readystatechange', checkState);
    checkState();
  });
};

ready().then(wrapperResolved);
```

Key concepts:
- Chaining allows code to be executed upon fulfillment of promise
- `.then()` performs an action after a promised result

This lesson covered:

- Chaining onto a promise using `.then()`
- Replicating jQuery's `.ready()` method
- Three states of `document.ready`: 'loading', 'interactive', 'complete'
  - DOM is ready to use once 'loading' is completed

## 51. Promise Syntax
### Day 51: July 1, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![Promises Course Map](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/prom1-23-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/prom1-23.jpg)

**Progress:** Started *Lesson 1: Creating Promises* from
- Udacity course: [JavaScript Promises](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-promises--ud898) by Google.

Key concepts:
- Promise is a constructor.
- A promise is a try-catch wrapper around code that will finish at an unpredictable time.
- You pass a function to the promise with two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`.
- `resolve` and `reject` are the two callbacks used to specify when a promise has either **fulfilled** (because something worked) or **rejected** (because something went wrong).

This lesson covered:

- Modifying a function to return a Promise.
- Wrapping async code with the Promise that is to be returned from that function.
- Calling `resolve()` on successful completion of async code within the Promise wrapper.
- Invoking the function and chaining `.then()` to the end in order to execute a callback upon successful fulfillment.

## 32. Restaurant App - Stage 1 Offline Images
### Day 32: June 12, 2018 - Tuesday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![App showing offline image](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/24-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/24.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1* project from the Udacity Nanodegree course: [Web Accessibility](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891).

Today I focused on getting some final touches completed for this project. Between today and tomorrow I should have everything ready for submission.

Today included the following.

- I added a generic offline image to be used as a placeholder for images that aren't available to the app if it happens to go offline before the requested image is cached
- Added a favicon to the app
- Added accessibility labels to the filter controls (so that screen readers can pick these up)

## 31. Restaurant App - Stage 1 Cached Assets
### Day 31: June 11, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![App delivering cached assets](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/23-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/assets/images/23.jpg)

**Progress:** Continued *Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1* project from the Udacity Nanodegree course: [Web Accessibility](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891).

This section of the code caches assets on service worker install and then serves these cached assets as requests are made.

```js
const staticCacheName = 'restaurant-static-001';

self.addEventListener('install', event => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(staticCacheName)
      .then(cache => {
        return cache.addAll([
          '/index.html',
          '/css/styles.css',
          '/js/dbhelper.js',
          '/js/register_sw.js',
          '/js/main.js',
          '/js/restaurant_info.js',
          '/data/restaurants.json',
          '/restaurant.html?id=1',
          '/restaurant.html?id=2',
          '/restaurant.html?id=3',
        ]).catch(error => {
          console.log('Caches open failed: ' + error);
        });
      })
  );
});
```

The cached assets were served if available otherwise a fetch operation is performed.

```js
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then(response => {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    }).catch(error => {
      return new Response('Not connected to the internet', {
        status: 404,
        statusText: "Not connected to the internet"
      });
      console.log(error, 'no cache entry for:', event.request.url);
    })
  );
});
```

  });
}
```

This was then included on each page.

## 18. The Picture Element
### Day 18: May 28, 2018 - Monday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![9-21](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/sm_ri9-21.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/full-size/ri9-21.png)
[![9-18](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/sm_ri9-18.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/full-size/ri9-18.png)

**Progress:** Continued *Lesson 9: Full Responsiveness* from the Udacity course: [Responsive Images](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882).

This lesson covered the `<picture>` element and how it's used in **art direction**.

- **art direction** is the process of using different images for different viewport sizes

Here's an example of what the code looks like for the kitty above:

```html
<picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="kitten-large.png">
    <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="kitten-medium.png">
    <img src="kitten-small.png" alt="Cute kitten">
</picture>
```

The browser chooses the first matching media query.

This markup says:
- Use 'kitten-large.png' when the viewport is 650px or larger
- Otherwise, use 'kitten-medium.jpg' if the viewport is 465px or larger.
- Otherwise fallback to 'kitten-small.png' if none of the conditions are met or if the browser doesn't support the `<picture>` element.

## 17. Using sizes with srcset
### Day 17: May 27, 2018 - Sunday

**Project:** Google Udacity Nanodegree (Mobile Web Specialist)

[![9-2](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/sm_ri9-9.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/assets/images/full-size/ri9-9.png)

**Progress:** Continued *Lesson 9: Full Responsiveness* from the Udacity course: [Responsive Images](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882).

This lesson covered the combination of `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.

- **srcset** - tells the browser which images and their widths it has available to choose from.
- **sizes** - tells the browser what the display size will be on the page given the size of the viewport

Here's an example:

```html
<img src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 1500w"
  sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw,
         50vw"
  alt="Wallaby">
```

This says we have three images sized at 500px, 1000px, & 1500px, respectively, and that the display size will be 100% the viewport width for viewport widths under 250px and will be 50% the viewport width for viewport widths over 250px.

The following items were covered

- Use of `srcset` with `sizes` attribute
- Necessity to still set image size through proper media queries
- How Chrome determines what the optimal sized image resource is to download

## 11. Grunt Automation for Responsive Images
### Day 11: May 21, 2018 - Monday

**Progress:** Continued *Lesson 7: Units, Formats, Environments* from the Udacity course: [Responsive Images](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882).

The course material was great at exposing me to new concepts of how to responsively serve images based on viewport size or device pixel density.

But it only scratched the surface on how to fully implement these responsive image techniques. I devoted some time to additional online resources to accomplish the following:

1. Understand how to fully implement **responsive image technologies**.
2. Implement **resolution switching** with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes of `<img>` tag.
    - **Resolution switching** serves the same image at a different size or resolution based on screen pixel density and/or viewport constraints.
3. Understand **art direction** through use of `<picture>` & `<source>` elements.
    - **Art direction** involves serving a different image based on space allocation.
4. Develop a sensible breakpoint system and use it to come up with ideal compression & dimension settings for image processing.
5. Implement Grunt (a task runner) to automate the process of creating multi-sized images.
6. Configure Grunt to update the HTML based on the set of images generated for each `<img>` element.

Those links are in my notes but I've included them below as well
